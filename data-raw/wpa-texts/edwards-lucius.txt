Interviewer's Comment

I went to see Lucius Edwards, age seventy-two, twice. He has colitis. He
wouldn't tell me anything. He said he was born in Shreveport, Louisiana
and his father took him away so young he knew no mother; his aunt raised
him. The first day he said he remembered all that about his parents'
owners. The next day the nurse had him cleaned up and nice meals were
sent in and still he wouldn't tell us anything. He told the nurse he had
farmed and worked on the railroad all his life. He was up but wouldn't
tell us anything. He told me, "I don't think I ever voted." We decided
he might be afraid he'd twist his tales and we'd catch him some way.
