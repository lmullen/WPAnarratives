MAGGIE JACKSON was born a slave of the Sam Oliver family, in Cass
     Co., Texas, near Douglasville. She is about 80 years old and her
     memory is not very good, so her story gives few details. She lives
     with her daughter near Douglasville, on highway #8.


"I am about 80 years old and was a chile during slavery times. My papa's
name was Tom Spencer Hall and my mama's name was Margaret Hall. My
brothers and sisters was Maria and Barbara and Alice and Octavia and
Andrew and Thomas and Hillary and Eugenia and Silas and Thomas. We was a

"My mama was Sam Oliver's slave, but my papa lived a mile away with
Masta Sam Carlow. We lived in box houses and slep' on wood beds and we
et co'nbread and peas and grits and lots of rabbits and 'possums. Mama
cooked it on the fireplace.

"Masta Sam's house was big and had six big rooms with a hall through the
middle and the kitchen sot way off in the ya'd and had a big cellar
under it. Masta Sam had a big orchard and put apples and pears in the
cellar for the winter. My brothers use' to slip under there and steal
them and mama'd whip 'em.

"The big house set 'mong big oak trees and the slaves houses was
scattered roun' the back. Masta Sam had a ole cowhorn he use' to blow
for the niggers to come outta the fiel'.

"Mos' all us chillen wen' fishin' on Saturday and we'd fish with pins.
One day I slipped off and caught a whole string of fish.

Dan Sherman, a cullud preacher from Jefferson. I married John 'cause I
loved him and we didn' fuss and fight. I has five chillen and five
