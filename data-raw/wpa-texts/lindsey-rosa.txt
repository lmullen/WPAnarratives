"I don't remember my mother and I hardly remember my father. My white
folks raised me up. I 'member my missis had me bound to her when I was
twelve. I know when my grandma come to take me home with her, I run
away from her and went back to my white folks.

"My white folks was rich. I belonged to my young missis. She didn't
'low nobody to hit me. When she went to school she had me straddle the
horse behind her. The first readin' I ever learned was from the white
folks.

pleased.

else.

"I come here to Arkansas with a young white lady just married. She
'suaded me to come with her and I just stayed.

ever'body lost now. There's some few young people is saved now but
they ain't many."
