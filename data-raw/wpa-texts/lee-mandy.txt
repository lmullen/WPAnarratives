"Yes'm I was a slave. I been here. I heard the bugles blowing, the
fife beat, the drums beat, and the cannons roar. We started to Texas
but never got across the river. I don't know what town it was but it
was just across the river from Texas. My white folks was good to me. I
staid with them till they died. Missy died first, then master died. I
never was away from them. They was both good. My mammy was sold but I
never was. They said they was surrendered when we come back from
Texas. I heard the drums beat at Ft. Smith when we come back but I
don't know what they was doing. I worked in the house with the
children and in the field too. I help herd the horses. I would card
and spin and eat peaches. No, that wasn't all I had to eat. I didn't
have enough meat but I had plenty of milk and potatoes. I was born
right here in Coal Hill. I ain't never lived anywhere else except when
we went South during the war.

"Law woman I can't tell you what I think of the present generation.
They are good in their way but they don't do like we did. I never did
go naked. I don't see how they stand it.

"I could sing when I was young. We sang everything, the good and
bad."
