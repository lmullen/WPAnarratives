Mr. Simms was born and raised on Mill Creek Kentucky, and now lives in
Madison Indiana on Poplar Street diagonally North West of the hospital.

He was so young he did no remember very much about how the slaves were
treated, but seemed to regret very much that he had been denied the
privilege of an education. Mr. Simms remembers seeing the lines of
soldiers on the Campbellsburg road, but referred to the war as the
"Revolution War".

This was a very interesting old man, when we first called, his daughter
invited us into the house, but her father wanted to talk outside where
he "spit better". When his daughter conveyed this information Mr. Simms'
immediately decided that we could come in as we "wouldn't be there long
anyhow".

After we gained entrance, the daughter remarked that her father was very
young at the time of the war, whereupon he answered very testily "If you
are going to tell it, go ahead. Or am I going to tell it?"
