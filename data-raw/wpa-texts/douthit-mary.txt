Note:—While the interviewer was questioning Charles Douthit, Farmington,
Missouri, negro, who was born in 1865, his wife standing in the door
looked rather wild-eyed, and unable to stand it any longer, finally
broke out with the following:—"Say! What are they gittin’ all dis stuff
fur anyway? I bet I know. They want ta find out how dey treated de ole
slaves so’s dey’ll know how to treat the young ’uns when dey makes dem
slaves. I bet they’re goin’ a try to have slaves again and dere are some
people who want slavery back but de people won’t stan’ fur hit now. I
don’t know what de government wants to do but de people would have a
most turrible war if dey tried to have slaves again. But ma muther who
worked for John Coffman in Ste. Genevieve County, wuz well treated. She
war really owned by the Missus and de Missus would not sell ma mamma.
When de war wuz ober de missus gave ma muther some land an built her a
beautiful home down dare. Ma muther wuz treated so good dat she stayed
an worked fur de Missus til de Missus died. I was borned down in dat
dare house dat de Missus built fur ma Muthuh and ma son lives dere now.
I was down dere las week, an I calls hit home."
