Lizzie was a child in the home of grandma and grandpa McMurry. They were
farmers in Robinson County, Tennessee.

Her mother, a slave hand, worked on the farm until her young master,
Robert McMurry was married. She was then sold to Rev. Carter Plaster and
taken to Logan County, Kentucky.

The child, Lizzie was given to young Robert. She lived in the house to
help the young mistress who was not so kind to her. Lizzie was forced to
eat chicken heads, fish heads, pig tails, and parsnips. The child
disliked this very much, and was very unhappy with her young mistress,
because in Robert's father's home all slave children were treated just
like his own children. They had plenty of good substantial food, and
were protected in every way.

The old master felt they were the hands of the next generation and if
they were strong and healthy, they would bring in a larger amount of
money when sold.

Lizzie's hardships did not last long as they were set free soon after
young Robert's marriage. He took her in a wagon to Keysburg, Kentucky to
be with her mother.

Lizzie learned this song from the soldiers.

  Old Saul Crawford is dead,
  And the last word is said.
  They were fond of looking back
  Till they heard the bushes crack
  And sent them to their happy home
  In Cannan.
  Some wears worsted
  Some wears lawn
  What they gonna do
  When that's all gone.


Interviewer's Comment

Mrs. Samuels is an amusing little woman, she must be about 80 years old,
but holds to the age of 60. Had she given her right age, the people for
whom she works would have helped her to get her pension.

They are amused, yet provoked because Lizzie wants to be younger than
she really is.
