Woodson to pick cotton. He dead now and I still tryin' to work all I
can.

"I haben voted in thirty-five year. Because I couldn't vote in the
Primary, then I say I wouldn't vote 'tall. I don't care if the women
want to vote. Don't do no good nohow.

"I farmed all my life 'ceptin' 'bout ten years I worked on the
section. I got so I couldn't stand up to it every day and had to farm
again.

"I never considered times hard till I got disabled to work. It mighty
bad when you can't get no jobs to do. My hardest time is in the
winter. I has a garden and chickens but I ain't able to buy a cow. Man
give me a little pig the other day. He won't be big enough to eat till
late next spring. Every winter times is hard for me. It's been thater
wa's ever since I begin not to be able to get about. Helped by the
PWA."
