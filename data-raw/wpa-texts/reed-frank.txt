"I was a little boy pickin' up chips and helpin' feed the hog in slavery
times for old master. Name was George Houston. That was in Alabama.

"I reckon I do remember George Houston. As far as I know he was good to
us. I remember when he died.

"Our people stayed right there after freedom. My mother was a Houston
till she married.

"I reckon I do remember the paddyrollers. I remember the hounds runnin'
too. I never thought I would remember that no more.

"They didn't get after me 'cause I was too little. It didn't last long
enough for 'em to get after me.

"I'm sick and not able to help myself. I got run over by a wagon.

"I'm livin' here with my daughter. Her husband is a preacher and they
got eight children, so you can imagine how much they can do for me.

"One word of the white folks is worth a thousand of ours."
