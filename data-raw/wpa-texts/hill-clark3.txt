"I heard a story 'bout a old colored man named Tony. It was in slave
times and he was prayin' to the Lord to take him out of bondage. He was
prayin', 'Oh Lord, come and take poor old Tony away.' Just then somebody
started knockin' and Tony says, 'Who'd dat?' 'It's the Lord, I come to
take you away.' Then Tony said, 'No! No! Don't take me away. I ain't
ready to go.'"
