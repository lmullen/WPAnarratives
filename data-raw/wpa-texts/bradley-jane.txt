"I was born in Newberry County, near the Laurens County line, above
Little River. Me and my mother belonged to the Workman family.
Afterwards, I belonged to Madison Workman. He was a good man to his
slaves. My work was around the house and home. I was too young to work
in the fields until after the war.

"I can't remember much about them times. I married there and soon after
come to town and lived, where I have worked ever since. I do washing and
other work.

"On the farm, the old folks had to cook outdoors, or in a kitchen away
off from the house. They had wide fireplaces where they put their pots
to cook the meals.

"I remember the old Little River Presbyterian Church where people would
go on Sundays. They would go in the mornings, and again in the
afternoons and have preaching."
