Fannie Gibson was born the slave property of Mr. Benajer Goff, a planter
of near Roanoke, Alabama. She says that during her girlhood she "piddled
in de fiels an hepped in de kitchen o’ de big house."

She has very pleasant memories of slave days, and "wishes to God dat she
was as comforbly (comfortably) fixed now as she was den."

Her ante-bellum owner she pictures as a very humane, Christian
gentleman—a man that took great interest in the material and spiritual
welfare of his slaves.

Two hymns, sung by ’Aunt’ Fannie for her interviewer, are appended.

    _Going Home To Live With The Lord._

    Goin’ home soon in de mornin’,
    Goin’ home soon in de mornin’,
    I’s goin’ home to live with de Lord.

    In de mornin’ so soon,
    In de mornin’ so soon,
    I’s goin’ home to live with de Lord.

    I’s goin’ home to live with de Lord,
    I’s goin’ home to live with de Lord,
    I’s goin’ home soon in de mornin’.

    O, de Lord is a-waitin’ for me,
    O, de Lord is a-waitin’ for me,
    I’s goin’ home soon in de mornin’.

    _Where Were You When You Found The Lord?_

    My brother, where were you,
    My brother, where were you,
    My brother, where were you,
      When you found the Lord?

    I was low down in the valley,
    I was low down in the valley,
    I was low down in the valley,
      When I first found the Lord.

    My sister, where were you,
    My sister, where were you,
    My sister, where were you,
      When you found the Lord?

    I was low down in the valley,
    I was low down in the valley,
    I was low down in the valley,
      When I first found the Lord.

This song can be extended indefinitely by addressing the question to
various members of one’s family, and to friends.
