NOBODY BUSINESS BUT MINE

 I.  Rabbit in de hollow,
     I ain' got no dog,
     How can I catch em?
     I do know! I do know!
     O Me! O Mine!
     Sorry dat if I leave my home,
     I gwine to my shack
     Wid de chicken on my back,
     Nobody business but mine.

 II. Rabbit in de hollow,
     Ain' got no dog,
     How can he catch em?
     I do know! I do know!
     O Me! O Mine!
     Let every nigger have his way,
     Gwine to his shack
     Wid he chicken on his back,
     Nobody business but his.
