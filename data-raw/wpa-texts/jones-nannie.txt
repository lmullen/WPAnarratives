"Good morning. Come in. I sure is proud to see you. Yes ma'am, I sure
is.

"I was born in Chicot County. I heerd Dr. Gaines say I was four years
old in slavery times. I know I ain't no baby. I feels my age, too--in
my limbs.

"I heerd 'em talk about a war but I wasn't big enough to know about
it. My father went to war on one side but he didn't stay very long. I
don't know which side he was on. Them folks all dead now--I just can
remember 'em.

"Dr. Gaines had a pretty big crew on the place. I'm gwine tell you
what I know. I can't tell you nothin' else.

"Now I want to tell it like mama said. She said she was sold from
Kentucky. She died when I was small.

"I remember when they said the people was free. I know they jumped up
and down and carried on.

"Dr. Gaines was so nice to his people. I stayed in the house most of
the time. I was the little pet around the house. They said I was so
cute.

"Dr. Gaines give me my age but I lost it movin'. But I know I ain't no
baby. I never had but two children and they both livin'--two girls.

"Honey, I worked in the field and anywhere. I worked like a man. I
think that's what got me bowed down now. I keeps with a misery right
across my back. Sometimes I can hardly get along.

"Honey, I just don't know 'bout this younger generation. I just don't
have no thoughts for 'em, they so wild. I never was a rattlin' kind of
a girl. I always was civilized. Old people in them days didn't 'low
their children to do things. I know when mama called us, we'd better
go. They is a heap wusser now. So many of 'em gettin' into trouble."
