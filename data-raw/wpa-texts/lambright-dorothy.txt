'longed to de Scotts what libbed in Jonesville Township. When I got big
'nough to work, I was gib to de youngest Scott boy. Soon atter dis,
Sherman come through Union County. No ma'm, I nebber seed Sherman but I
seed some of his soldiers. Dat's de time I run off in de wood and not
narry a soul knowed whar I was till de dus' had done settled in de big
road.

"Every Sunday, Marse Scott sent us to church in one of his waggins.
White folks rid to church in de buggy and Marse went on de big saddle
hoss. 'Bout dis time, Marse Scott went to Columbia to git coffee and
sugar. He stay mos' two weeks, kaize he drive two fine hosses to de
buggy 'long wid a long hind end to fetch things to and fro in. De roads
was real muddy and de hosses haf to res' ever night. Den in Columbia, he
would have a little 'joyment befo' he come back home."
