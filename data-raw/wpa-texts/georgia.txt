"No, honey, I neber seed my mammy. She died when I was bawn, an’ my
Mistis Mary Mitchell raised me in de Big House. I was named a’ter her
sister, Miss Georgia. I slep’ in her room an I was a house nigger all my
days. I neber went to a nigger chu’ch ’tell I was grown an’ ma’d, didn’
sociate wid niggers ’cause I was a nu’smaid. I raised Miss Molly, her
las’ baby.

"I was bawn at ’Elmoreland’, Massa Americus Mitchell’s place, mor’n
ninety yeahs ago, an’ a’ter freedom I stayed dah ’tel ole Massa died an’
my Mistis moved to Eufaula to live wid her son, Mahs Merry.

"’Bout all I know of de wawh is when dey said—’de Yankees is comin’, de
Yankees is comin’.’

"Us sho’ was skeerd, an’ dere’d be some fas’ doin’s about de place. All
de cattle an’ hawgs an hosses we driv’ to de swamp on de nawth creek,
an’ de feather beds down dere too an’ hid ’em in de brush an’ leaves. My
Mistis tied her trinkets in sacks an’ put ’em in outlandish places lak
de hen-house an de hay lof’. An’ de silver, dey planted in de fiel."
