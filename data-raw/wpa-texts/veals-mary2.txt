"I don't own no house. I live in a rented house. Yes, I work fer my
living. I don't 'member much 'bout slavery except what I heard my daddy
and mammy say. My pa was Washing Holloway and my ma was Polly Holloway.
Dey belonged to Judge O'Neall, and lived at his place 'bout three miles
from town, near Bush River.

"Judge O'Neall's house was real old, and dey had a store near it called
Springfield, a kind of suburb at dat time.

"After de war, we didn't have much clothes, 'cause everything was so
high. Judge O'Neall died befo' de war was over, and his wife went to
Mississippi to live wid her married daughter. After de war, Miss Sallie,
who was Judge O'Neall's daughter, learn't me to read and write, and
other things in books.

"My father and mother went to de white folks' church in slavery time.
After de war, de negroes built deir first church and called it a 'brush
arbor'. A negro preacher named Simon Miller was a good man and done lots
of good when he preached in de brush arbor. Dis was on de old Banduslian
Springs hill, near de south fork of Scotts Creek."
