Joe Robinson was born in Mason County, Kentucky in 1854.

His master, Gus Hargill, was very kind to him and all his slaves. He
owned a large farm and raised every kind of vegetation. He always gave
his slaves plenty to eat. They never had to steal food. He said his
slaves had worked hard to permit him to have plenty, therefore they
should have their share.

Joe, his mother, a brother, and a sister were all on the same
plantation. They were never sold, lived with the same master until they
were set free.

Joe's father was owned by Rube Black, who was very cruel to his slaves,
beat them severely for the least offense. One day he tried to beat Joe's
father, who was a large strong man; he resisted his master and tried to
kill him. After that he never tried to whip him again. However, at the
first opportunity, Rube sold him.

The Robinson family learned the father had been sold to someone down in
Louisiana. They never heard from, or of him, again.
