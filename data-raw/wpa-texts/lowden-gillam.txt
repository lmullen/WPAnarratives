"I was born at Greenwood, S.C. about 1862. I can’t ’member anything
'bout de Confederate War or anything right after de war. I heard my
mammy and daddy talk ’bout de patrollers but I don’t know much. My daddy
was Abram Lowden and my mammy was Sidney Williams dat married my daddy.
Our marster in slavery was Dr. Davis, and his wife, our mistress, was
Miss Martha Davis. Dey didn’t learn us to read and write.

"Atter de war, my mammy always done washing on Sad’day atternoons, and
us little chaps helped to tote water and bring her wood. I ’member de
old brick oven our marster had. Dey cooked lots of bread on Sad’day
atternoons to last several days. Den we had corn-shuckings, de women had
quiltings.

"Us chaps didn’t play many games ’cept marbles, rope-skipping, and
jumping high rope. We didn’t git to go to school.

"Some of de cures dey made was from gypsum weed, which was boiled into a
tea and drunk. Thread-salve buds was picked and strung on thread like a
necklace, den put around de neck to keep off chills.

"I jined de church when I was 31 years old, because I was seeking
salvation. I wanted God to release me from my sins and dat was de way I
had to do it. We can’t git along widout Jesus.

"I never did think anything ’bout Jeff Davis or Abraham Lincoln, and
don’t know nothing ’bout Booker Washington."
