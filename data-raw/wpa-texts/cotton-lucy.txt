"Lucy Cotton's my name, and I was born on the tenth day of June, 1865,
jist two months after the surrender. No suh, I ain't no kin to the other

was owned by a master named Wilson.

"I've belonged to the Holiness Church six years. (They call us
'Holiness,' but the real name is Pentecostal.)

girl--especially among the young people. I think no woman, white or

their 'damns' and it sure don't soun' right to me.

"Good day, mistah. I wish you well--but the gov'ment ain't gonna do
nothing. It never has yit."
