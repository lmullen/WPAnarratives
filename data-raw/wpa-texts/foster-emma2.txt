"I know I marked one of my babies with beer. It was 'cause I wanted some
beer and couldn't get it. And when it was born it had a place on the
back of its neck looked like beer and she just foamed at the mouth. And
when she was about a week old I got some beer and give it to her with a
teaspoon and she quit foamin'.

"And another time there was a boy on the place had a finger that the
doctor had done took the bone out. He and I used to love to rassle
(wrestle) and one day he said, 'Oh, Emma, you hurt my finger.' And like
a fool, you know I took his hand and just rubbed that finger. And do you
know, when my baby was born it had six fingers on each hand."
