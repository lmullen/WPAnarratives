I was born a slave, my owner was Mr. Rhodes of Virginia. On a large
plantation, my white folks gave a big to do, and served wine. Had corn
shuckings. Swapped help around harvesting time. I was sold when 6 or 7
years old. Sold to highest bidder. First marster gave my mother to his
white daughter and let her keep me.

I was raised as a house boy. I was always a mean boy. When I was sold
I split another boys head open with an axe. Then I runned off. They
caught me with blood hounds. My master whipped me with a cowhide whip.
He made me take my clothes off and tied me to a tree. He would use the
whip and then take a drink out of a jug and rest awhile, then he would
whip me again.

Sometimes we would set up until midnight pickin' wool. I would get so
sleepy, couldn't hardly pick de wool.

I hung up my stocking at Christmas to get gifts.

When we left de plantation, we had to get a pass to go from one
plantation to another.

We went to church, sat on de back seat of the white folks church. It
was a Baptist. Baptized in pool. White preacher said: "Obey your
master."

When I came to Arkanansas, I was sold to Mr. Larkin.
