"I was born in Anderson County, South Carolina. My papa was Abe Brown
and my mama was Lizzie White. She died when I was a baby and Miss Nancy
White took me up to her house and raised me. Her husband was Mars Henry
White. They was good to me. Miss Nancy was the best. They treated me
like their own boy. It was done freedom then but my papa stayed on the
place. I learned to do up the night turns, slop the hogs and help bout
the milkin'. They had young calves to pull off. I toted in the wood and
picked up chips. She done everything for me and all the mother I knowed.

"When I was seven years old my papa pulled me off to Arkansas. We come
on a immigration ticket, least I recken we did. I don't think my papa
paid our way. We was brought here. The land was better they told em.

"We settled in the woods close to Mariana and commenced farmin'. I been
farmin' and workin' in the timber and I carpenters a little. The timber
is gone.

"I supports myself all I can. I own a little house at Clarendon I recken
is the reason I don't get no Government help."
