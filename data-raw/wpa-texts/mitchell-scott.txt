As told by Scott Mitchell, a former slave:


Scott Mitchell, claims his age as somewhere in the 70's but his wool is
white on the top of his head. Negroes don't whiten near as quickly as
white people, evidently he is nearly 90, or there-a-bouts.

County whah I wuz bohn, right wif my masteh and mistress. Captin Hester
