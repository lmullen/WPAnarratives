"I was born in old Abbeville County, S.C. about 1861; was reared in what
is now Greenwood County. My father was Winston Arnold and my mother,
Sophronia Lomax Arnold. They belonged to the Arnold family during
slavery time. I was just a small child during the Confederate War, and
don't remember anything about it. I heard my mother tell about some
things though. The slaves earned no money and were just given quarters
to live in and something to eat. My father was a blacksmith on master's
place, and after the war, he was blacksmith for himself. I heard him
tell about the patrollers. They had lots of cornshuckings and cotton
pickings, but they never worked at night.

"I remember the night-riders, but don't remember that they did any harm
much except they got after a man once.

"When any of us got sick we sent for a doctor, but old-time folks I
heard about, would use herbs, tree barks, and the like of that to make
teas to drink.

"I married in a negro church when I was young. I married Frank Fair who
came from Newberry County, S.C. After the ceremony, the neighbors gave
me a nice dinner at the church.

"I don't remember anything about Lincoln or Jeff Davis, but I think
Booker Washington is a leading colored man and has done good.

"I joined the church when I was nine years old, because my father and
mother belonged, and so many young people were joining. I think
everybody ought to join a church."
