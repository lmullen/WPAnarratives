"I was born close to Hernando, Mississippi. My parents was Cassie
Gillahm and Ely Gillahm. My master was John Gillahm. I fell to John
Gillahm and Tim bought me from him so I could be with my mother. I was a
young baby. Bill Gillahm was our old master. He might had a big farm but
I was raised on a small farm. White folks raised me. They put me to
sewing young. I sewed with my fingers. I could sew mighty nice. My
mistress had a machine she screwed on a table.

"All the Gillahms went to Louisiana in war time and left the women with
youngest white master. They was trying to keep their slaves from
scattering. They were so sure that the War would be lost.

"The Yankees camped close to us but didn't bother my white folks to hurt
them. They et them out time and ag'in. I seen the Yankees every day. I
seen the cannons and cavalry a mile long. The sound was like eternity
had turned loose. Everything shook like earthquakes day and night. The
light was bright and red and smoke terrible.

"Mother cooked and we et from our master's table.

"We was all scared when the War was on and glad it was over. Mama died
at the close. Me and my sister sharecropped and made seven bales of
cotton in one year.

"When freedom come on, our master and mistress told us. We all cried.
Miss Mollie was next to our own mother. She raised us. We kept on their
place.

"I cooked for Joe Campbell at Forrest City. He had one boy I help to
raise. They think well of me."

Very light mulatto. Bed fast and had two rolls and a cup of coffee. Had
been alone all day except when Home Aid girls bathed and cleaned her
bed. She is paralyzed. She said she was hungry.
