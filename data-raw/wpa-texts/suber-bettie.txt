"I was born near old Bush River Baptist Church in Newberry County, S.C.
This was the white folks' church, but the colored folks have a Bush
River church in that section now. I was grown when the war started. I
was a slave of Bonny Floyd. He was a good man who owned several slaves
and a big farm. I was the house-girl then, and waited on the table and
helped around the house. I was always told to go to the white folks'
church and sit in the gallery.

"When the Patrollers was started there, they never did bother Mr.
Bonny's slaves. He never had any trouble with them, for his slaves never
run away from him.

"The Ku Klux never come to our place, and I don't remember seeing them
in that section.

"We took our wheat to Singley's Mill on Bush River to be ground. We made
all our flour and grain. We plowed with horses and mules.

"I am an old woman, sick in bed and can't talk good; but glad to tell
you anything I can."
