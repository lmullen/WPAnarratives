"I was born in Newberry County near Cannon's Creek section in the Dutch
Fork. I was a slave of Lemuel Lane. He was killed by some slaves just
after freedom. They killed him for his money but didn't find any, it was
said. When freedom come, my mistress give me some things to eat when we
left.

"I can't work much any more; I am old and I can't get about. I live with
my son who works when he can find work. We rent a two-room cottage in
town.

"I never heard anything about slaves getting 40 acres of land and a
mule. None in that section got any. We had to go to work for other
people.

"The Ku Klux Klan never bothered us then, and we never had nothing to do
with them, nor with politics.

"There was no slaves living in our section who had come from Virginia."
