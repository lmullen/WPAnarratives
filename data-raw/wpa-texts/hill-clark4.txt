"I've heard if a turkle dove, when the season first starts, comes to
your house and starts moanin', it's a sign you is goin' to move out and
somebody else goin' move in.

"If a squinch owl starts howlin' 'round your house and if you turn your
shoe upside down at the door, they sure will hush. Now I know that's so.

"I used to run myself nearly to death tryin' to get to the end of the
rainbow to get the pot of gold.

"And I've heard the old folks say if you start any place and have to go
back, you make a circle on the ground and spit in it or you'll have bad
luck."
