"I was born in Union County, S. C., not far from the ferry on Tyger
River. My mother was a slave of George R. Tucker who lived on the Enoree
River. I can't remember slavery times nor the war; but I remember about
the end of the war when everybody was coming home.

"My mother was a weaver, going to the white folks' houses and weaving
clothes for them for small pay. Carding and spinning was done by all the
white families at home.

"The farms had large gardens and raised most everything to eat. Large
patches of turnips, cabbage and green vegetables was the custom at that
time."
