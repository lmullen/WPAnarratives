Mrs. Bowman was born in Woodford County, Kentucky in 1859.

Her master, Joel W. Twyman was kind and generous to all of his slaves,
and he had many of them.

The Twyman slaves were always spoken of, as the Twyman "Kinfolks."

All slaves worked hard on the large farm, as every kind of vegetation
was raised. They were given some of everything that grew on the farm,
therefore there was no stealing to get food.

The master had his own slaves, and the mistress had her own slaves, and
all were treated very kindly.

Mrs. Bowman was taken into the Twyman "big house," at the age of six, to
help the mistress in any way she could. She stayed in the house until
slavery was abolished.

After freedom, the old master was taken very sick and some of the former
slaves were sent for, as he wanted some of his "Kinfolks" around him
when he died.


Interviewer's Comment

Mrs. Bowman was given the Twyman family bible where her birth is
recorded with the rest of the Twyman family. She shows it with pride.

Mrs. Bowman said she never knew want in slave times, as she has known it
in these times of depression.
